            <h3>Pampered Chef</h3>
            <h4>Systems Architect</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I worked as a Systems Architect for Pampered Chef. Pampered Chef is working hard to revamp their web
                    presence. The goal is to help consultants and make their business easier. To do so, we release new
                    and mobile friendly tools & applications. The Pampered Chef purpose statement is "Enriching lives
                    one meal and one memory at a time," and we firmly believe in it.</li>
                <li>We are moving away from legacy platforms and adopting MEAN stack. We rely on AWS as our cloud
                    provider and add tools as and when necessary for our projects.</li>
                <li>This digital transformation has allowed me to learn a lot of new technologies and pick the one
                    that's right for the task at hand.</li>
                <li>I helped build the Party Landing Page (2nd most visited page for Pampered Chef), Shared Rewards (a
                    completely new party type) that included implementation of GCPP (Global Cart and Payment Platform
                    using Braintree) and cart handling using CommerceTools.</li>
                <li>The role included actively hiring, mentoring and pair programming with new and senior developers.

            <h3>J. Walter Thompson Worldwide</h3>
            <h4>Global Technical Lead</h4>
            <p>
                Position at Mirum Shopper/HeathWallace<br />
                For this Enterprise-Level Project, HSBC, the sixth largest, British-based, multinational bank, the task
                was to create a new product onboarding web application which would replace the existing US product
                onboarding solution.<br />
                The product onboarding application would then be integrated with the current Staff Front End (SFE)
                system.
                The product onboarding application will allow the staff users (branch and call center) to open product
                accounts for HSBC customers.
                It will be integrated with SFE so that once the staff users log into SFE, they will be able to launch
                product onboarding application seamlessly within SFE.
                At a high level, the product onboarding journey will have the following steps:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>Applicant selection</li>
                <li>Product selection</li>
                <li>Product and Funding configuration</li>
                <li>Terms and Charges acceptance</li>
